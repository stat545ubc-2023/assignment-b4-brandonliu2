# Assignment B-4

For this assignment, I have chosen option A, exercise 1 and 2.  

## Exercise 1: *Emma*

For exercise 1, I made a graph of the top twenty most common words in *Persuasion* from `janeaustenr`.

## Exercise 2: *pig_latin_custom*

For exercise 2, I made a function called `pig_latin_custom` which converts words into my own version of Pig Latin. 

- For words beginning with a consonant, the first letter is moved to the end of the word.
- For words beginning with a vowel, the last letter is moved to the beginning of the word.
- After rearrangement, "abc" is added to the end of the word.
